# CoAP_PubSub
A CoAP Publish/Subscribe library developed for feasibility purpose and performance evaluations

Developed as part of the Master by Research study at Mid-Sweden university (https://www.miun.se/) from March 2017 until Sept 2018.

-> An enourmous THANK YOU towards the awesome people developing and maintaining the CoAP Californium (https://github.com/eclipse/californium) library!! Parts of this project work are based on this superb library.
